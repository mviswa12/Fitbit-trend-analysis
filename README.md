## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes Fitbit user data to create an interactive dashboard that allows users to monitor their activity and compare trends with friends. Using Microsoft Access for database management and Power BI for visualization, the application provides a comprehensive view of fitness tracking metrics like steps taken, distance covered, calories burned, and sleep monitoring.

## üîç Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project comes from a publicly available Fitbit dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between April 12, 2016 and May 12, 2016. It includes data from 27 Fitbit users who consented to the submission of their personal tracker data, featuring:

- **Physical Activity Metrics**: Steps taken, distances covered, activity intensity levels
- **Heart Rate Monitoring**: Heart rate changes throughout the day
- **Sleep Tracking**: Sleep duration, sleep quality metrics
- **Calories**: Calorie expenditure throughout the day
- **Weight Logs**: Weight measurements over time

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Access**: Database design, form creation, and application development
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard creation and data visualization
- **SQL**: Data querying and manipulation
- **VBA**: Macro development for application functionality
- **IDEF Modeling**: For system architecture design (IDEF0 and IDEF1X)

## üèóÔ∏è Application Architecture

### Project Approach
The project followed a waterfall model of development with the following phases:
1. Project Selection
2. Data Cleaning
3. IDEF Modeling
4. Form Creation
5. Visualization

### System Modeling
- **IDEF0 Model**: Functional modeling that defines the system activities
- **IDEF1X Model**: Data modeling that defines the semantic data structure
- **Entity Relationship Diagram**: Representing the database relationships

## üíª Application Implementation

### User Interface Components
1. **Main Display Form**: Entry point with user login functionality
2. **User Guide Form**: Welcome page with information about the application
3. **New User Registration Form**: Account creation for new Fitbit users
4. **User Dashboard Form**: Displays monthly activity metrics
5. **Compete with Friends Form**: Allows comparison of metrics with other users
6. **Forgot Member Form**: Password recovery functionality

### Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system with password recovery
- **Activity Monitoring**: Visual representations of steps, distance, and calories
- **Friend Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison with friends' activity metrics
- **Monthly Trends**: Graphical representation of metrics over time
- **Weight Tracking**: Monitor weight changes over the tracking period

### Technical Components
- **Macros**: 20+ custom macros for form navigation and data manipulation
- **Queries**: SQL queries to extract and analyze user data
- **Charts**: Interactive visualizations for activity metrics
- **PowerBI Integration**: Advanced dashboards with filtering capabilities

## üìä Visualization

### Microsoft Access Charts
- Monthly steps graph
- Monthly distance graph
- Monthly calories burned graph
- Monthly weight graph

### Power BI Dashboards
- User activity dashboard with metrics like:
  - Average of very active minutes
  - Average of sedentary minutes 
  - Average heart rate
  - Daily calorie expenditure tracking
- Comparative dashboard with multiple user metrics including:
  - Side-by-side calorie comparison
  - Very active minutes comparison
  - Heart rate variations
  - Distance covered

## üîÑ Future Scope

1. **Web Integration**: Develop web access to the database for easy login through phones/tablets
2. **Additional Features**: Expand user metrics to include protein, fat intake, and other nutritional data
3. **Goal Setting**: Implement functionality for users to set, monitor, and edit fitness goals
